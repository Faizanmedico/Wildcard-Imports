Wildcard Imports in TypeScript
TypeScript, like modern JavaScript, supports the concept of modules, which allows you to organize your code into separate files and reuse them across your application.
One of the features of TypeScript modules is the ability to use wildcard imports.
In this article, weâ€™ll explore what wildcard imports are, how to use them, and provide examples to illustrate their usage.

What are Wildcard Imports?
Wildcard imports allow you to import all the exported members from a module as a single object. 
This can be particularly useful when you need to access multiple exports from a module without importing each one individually.
Wildcard imports use the import * as syntax.
